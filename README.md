# Ame
*A sweet distribution of Drupal.*

The goal of this project is to integrate web components with Drupal, enabling
frontend teams to deliver beautiful assets that are fully compatible with
Drupal's rendering layer.

There isn't much to see right now, but if you want to get started quickly head
over to the [Ame Docker](https://github.com/mortenson/ame-docker) project and
follow the setup instructions there.
